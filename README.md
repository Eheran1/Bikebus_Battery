# Bikebus_Battery
With this code, you can replace a battery from an ebike with the bikebus communication system (like the Bulls SPORTSLITE Green Mover). 
The BMS in the new battery is from Daly, so that is what the code expects to communicate with. But you could use any other BMS with or without communication with fairly minimal adaptation. All you really need is roughly the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and, if you want to look at it, the current draw. The other values are not really usefull.
